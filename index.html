  <div class="container" id="about">
  
  <p>Hello I am Anas, This is my first website I`m creating, let me know what you think and what can I improve in the future üßê </p>
  <main>
      <h3 > A little a bit about me üòé</h3>
        <p>I decided to become a Software Development to gain more confidence in a working environment and
           build a better career <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> current job is something I enjoy doing, 
           however, I would not see myself going forward with my current job.
          I have been thinking of studying something related to the same field I am in. Which I enjoy doing. 
           I was thinking of starting alot of things to have different career. however, I did not know where to start. 
           After a friendof mine joined CYF and informed me that there is a better start for you to build a better career
           with the right people that can help you gain more skills that you need. I didn't hestaie and
           I asked where i can find CYF. I completed the application. Furthermore, I started the first step. 
           I never coded in my life, and I find it interesting learning how to code. 
           Since I was young I had an interest in computers how to fix etc.
           I felt stuck somehow but here we are now creating first website ü§ó. 
           Code Your Future gave little hope that I can continue with my dream to find a job that
           I can work anywhere in the world.</span> </p>
