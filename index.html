      <p> My name is Anas Othman; As part of my Journey to become software development I am working currently with a company called Bates IT. I’m currently work in a hospital.  My role requires me to provide 2nd line support, where I take part fixing computers.
      </p>

      <h2> Why I want to become a software development </h2>
      <p>I decided to become a Software Development to gain more confidence in a working environment and build a better career. My current job is something I enjoy doing, however, I would not see myself going forward with my current job.</p><span id="dots"></span>
      <span id="more">I have been thinking of studying something related to the same field I am in. Which I enjoy doing. I was thinking of starting security cyber, cloud and software development. However, I did not know where to start. After a friend joined CYF informed me that there is a better start for you to build a better career with the right people that can help you gain more skills that you need. I didn't think about it at all, and I was told to send me the link to join CYF. I completed the application. Furthermore, I started the first step. I never coded in my life, and I find it interesting learning how to code, which I see as the future for me of where I come from as my background. I arrived in England in 2012. I was living in Syria my family migrated from Somalia because of the war and my parents thought this is the best decision. Since I was young I had an interest in computers how to fix etc. I didn't have the opportunity to build myself or learn. since I arrive in England I try to pick myself up and follow my dream. at this stage, I feel stuck and not progressing in my dream. conde your future gave little hope that I can continue with my dream to find a job I can work remotely and travel at the same time,</span>
